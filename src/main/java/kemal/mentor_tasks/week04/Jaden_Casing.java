//    Jaden Casing Strings
//    Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After
//    Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter.
//    When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For
//    simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to
//    be in the example below.
//    Your task is to write a method that converts strings to how they would be written by Jaden
//    Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the
//    same way he originally typed them.
//    Note that this function should a return empty string for an empty string or null.
//    Example:
//    Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
//    Jaden-Cased: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
